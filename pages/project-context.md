## Project Context

<br>

#### Overview 
<br>
This digital collection exhibits the archaeological journal kept by Clarence Kennedy from 1895 to 1897. The journal describes Kennedy’s travels around the Midwest, primarily Indiana and Kentucky, as he excavates mounds and other Native American sites. Due to the sensitive nature of the content, many sections of the journal have been redacted from public viewing. This journal and related material by Clarence Kennedy are currently held by the Indiana Univeristy Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.


#### About Clarence 
<br>
Clarence Hamilton Kennedy, professor emeritus of zoology and entomology at the Ohio State University, was born in Rockport, Indiana, on June 25, 1879. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1902 and Master’s in 1903, both in Zoology from Indiana University. Clarence briefly taught at IU before becoming a scientific assistant in the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. He collected biological material in Oregon, Texas, Nevada, and California, including a systematic collection of Odonata (dragonflies). In 1915, Clarence graduated with a master’s degree from Stanford and then began teaching at Cornell. He was awarded his Ph.D. from Cornell in 1919 and began teaching at the Ohio State University. Clarence married Lydia June Findley in 1927, and they had two children, Bruce and Mary. He became a full professor in 1933 and retired in 1950. Clarence was President of the American Entomological Society in 1935, and he was also in the Economic Entomologists and the Society of Naturalists, on the Editorial Board of the American Ecological Society, and Fellow and then Vice President of Zoology of the Ohio Academy of Science. Clarence published over 70 biological papers during his career and was awarded an honorary Ph.D. in 1950 from Indiana University. He died June 6, 1952.


#### The Journal
<br>
This journal has entries from May 1895 through April 1897, with the majority from 1896, when Clarence would have been 17 years old. He labeled the journal “Notes on Archaeology of Spencer Co. Ind., Daviess Co. Ky.” The contents of the entries almost exclusively describe the excavation of Native American mounds and what was found there. Descriptions have some details, including soil layers, area measurements, and descriptions of recovered material, but not the depth that would be expected in archaeological work today. They are sometimes accompanied by small sketches of recovered material or excavated layers. There are 38 individual entries, ranging from a sentence to several pages in length. The time between entries is fairly irregular, some weeks apart from each other. It is likely that Clarence was investigating these sites in his time off from another job or chores at home. He commonly traveled and worked with Arthur Veack, and Professor Morganthaler from Rockport is also occasionally referenced in Clarence’s writing. 

The journal is currently the property of the Indiana University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, who have permission to digitize and share the contents of journals like this if sensitive material is censored. This includes any coordinates or exact site locations, descriptions or depictions of human remains, or drawings and descriptions of other material that is sensitive to the Indigenous populations.

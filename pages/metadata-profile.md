## Metadata Application Profile

#### Context 
This journal was kept by Clarence Kennedy, a white, amateur archaeologist, 1895-1897 as he worked at various Native American archaeological sites in the Midwest. Native American Removal Act was signed in 1830, and the Miami were the last to be forced from Indiana in the 1840s. Therefore, some Indigenous sites in the region were only vacated within a generation or two of them becoming “archaeological sites,” so it is possible that the sites described by Clarence were recently occupied. Thus, his work would not have been ethical by today’s standards. 

The journal is currently the property of the Indiana University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, who have permission to digitize and share the contents of journals like this as long as sensitive material is censored. This includes any coordinates or exact site locations, depictions of human remains, or drawings and descriptions of other material that is sensitive to the Indigenous populations. 

#### Content
This journal records the field notes of Clarence Kennedy as he worked on dig sites in Spencer County, Indiana and Daviess County, Kentucky. Some passages appear to be credited to A. Veack, likely copied from a colleague’s writings. The contents of the entries almost exclusively describe the excavation of burial mounds and what was found during their process. Descriptions have some detail, including soil layers, area measurements, and descriptions of recovered material, but not the depth that would be expected in archaeological work today. Many entries are short, only about a paragraph long. In addition, entries do not occur daily but can be weeks apart. They are sometimes accompanied by small sketches of recovered material or excavated layers. 

#### Users

The target audience for this journal is primarily researchers interested in Native American archaeological sites, especially those in the Midwest. They may be researching Indigenous cultures, the history of archaeological practices, or the history of the region. The audience could also include history, anthropology, or archaeology students at IU. The journal could be used in classes to use in discussions of any of the aforementioned topics or studied as a historical object by itself. Library science students could also examine the journal in the context of rare books and special collections, as well as use it as an example for transcription practice, since the writing is cursive, but still relatively legible.
